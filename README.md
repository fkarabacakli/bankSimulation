# Bank Simulation

This repository contains a bank simulation project developed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming 2 (OOP2)** course. The project focuses on simulating real-world banking operations using object-oriented programming principles.

## Features

- **Customer Management:** Create, update, and manage customer accounts.
- **Transactions:** Perform deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.
- **Banking Operations:** Simulate real-world banking scenarios like loan management and account statements.
- **OOP Concepts:** Implements inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- **File Handling:** Stores and retrieves customer data using file operations.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to:

1. Demonstrate the application of object-oriented programming concepts in solving real-world problems.
2. Develop a scalable and modular codebase.
3. Explore file handling and basic data persistence techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java
- **OOP Concepts:** Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction
- **File Handling:** Reading and writing data to files for persistence
